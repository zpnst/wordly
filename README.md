## History

Our university had a discipline called "procedural programming".                                                                                                                                            
In order not to take the exam, it was possible to take some small C++ project.

This game was written for my classmate, who drew me a portrait of my cat for it.

## The rules of the game

In the file dictionary.txt The words that participate in the game are presented, they must be of 5 letters.

The rules of the game are easy to describe with an example.                                                                                                                                                
You have 6 attempts to guess the word made by the computer.                                                                                                                                                
If the letter is in its place in the hidden word, it lights up in green, if the letter is in the hidden word, but it is not in its place, it lights up in blue.
